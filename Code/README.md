Assumptions: 
1. I am assuming you can only declare one variable per line in the variable declaration part as doing the
    list caused many recursion errors
2. I am assuming that the user inputs correct information in many locations through out the pascal
    program. It is simply too difficult to account for all possible errors so there would be no situation,
    for instance, of a user input a boolean value for a real variable or something similar to that
